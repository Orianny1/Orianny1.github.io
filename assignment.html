<table align="center" border="1" width="800">\
<tr>\
<td>Goals </td>\
<td>Actionable Steps </td>\
</tr>\
<tr>\
<td>Increase my GPA </td>\
<td>This can be done by getting higher grades through practices of completing all my assignments, study for large exams, and learning to the best of my ability. </td>\
</tr>\
<tr>\
<td>Be a leader in my ESL Tutor volunteer position</td>\
<td>I can accomplish this by bringing up ideas to improve the program I work for, become a reliable person for my superiors and mentors, and help my peers with the knowledge and skills I have. </td>\
</tr>\
<tr>\
<td>Grow in my Fundraisng Intern position</td>\
<td>I can accomplish this mostly through trial and error. This is a task that I have never taken up before so I will rely heavy on my previous skills, my eagerness to learn, and my peers who have a wide range of helpful skills as well.  </td>\
