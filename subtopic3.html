        <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>In this peer reviewed journal the authors examine how online platforms like social media impact mental health in people. To collect data and examine this the authors conducted an online survey which consisted of 343 participants. In this study various factors were analyzed including the directionality of comparison with social media users, the frequency and intensity of social comparison, individual differences and vulnerability between social media users, the nature of the content the social media users are exposed to, the salience of comparison between social media users, and comparison targets. All these factors aided to the final findings that most of these finds showed significant influence on mental health outcomes except comparison targets and individual differences. </td></tr>
